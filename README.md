# Differentiator

This is a symbolic differentiation and expression graph analysis tool. 

On input it recieves mathematical expressions using a special notation, which are then converted to a graph, on which further transformations are performed.

Under the hood, the expression graph is differentiated node-wise, and then various transformation passes for constant foldings are performed.
